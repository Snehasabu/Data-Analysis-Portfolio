Overview

This project analyzes user submission data from a mentor-based learning platform to evaluate performance, engagement, and improvement trends.
It demonstrates SQL skills in data aggregation, conditional logic, ranking, and time-based analytics using PostgreSQL.

The main business goal is to help identify:

1. Which mentors or learners are most consistent performers
2. Which users need intervention or training
3. When engagement and accuracy peak throughout the week
