NLP TF-IDF Project

Overview

This project explores a text dataset and builds a classification model using TF-IDF vectorization. The notebook contains EDA, preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

Contents

1. notebooks/ — 04_NLP_TFIDF_Project_Final.ipynb
2. data/ — text dataset(s) used in the project
3. models/ — saved model artifacts (e.g., nlp_tfidf_pipeline_v1.joblib)

Highlights

1. Cleaned and preprocessed text (lowercase, stopword removal, tokenization, optional lemmatization)
2. TF-IDF vectorization with tuned n-gram and max-features settings
3. Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
4. Feature importance: top TF-IDF tokens per class
