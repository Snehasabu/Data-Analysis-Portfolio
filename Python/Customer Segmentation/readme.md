Dimensionality reduction (PCA) was used for better visualization and cluster interpretation.

Highlights
Standardized features (e.g., income, spending score, age) before clustering.
Determined optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Visualized clusters in 2D using PCA.
Derived actionable business insights from cluster analysis.
Key Insights
High-income, high-spending customers form a distinct premium group.
Middle-income customers with balanced spending can be targeted for loyalty programs.
Low-spending groups can be engaged via budget-friendly offers.
Next Steps
Automate cluster labeling and profiling.
Deploy an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly).
Integrate segmentation model into recommendation systems.
Tech Stack
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, PCA, K-Means
