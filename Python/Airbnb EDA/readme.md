This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listing data to uncover insights related to pricing, availability, host behavior, and location-based trends.
The goal is to understand what factors influence Airbnb listing prices and availability, and to present clear, data-driven observations.

This project focuses only on EDA, not machine learning, to demonstrate strong data analysis, visualization, and business insight skills.
